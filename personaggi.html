        <p>Don Quixote is a spanish <em>hidalgo</em>, but his true name is
            Alonso Quixano and he's 50 years old. He loves chivalric romances so much that
            he has lost touch with reality: in fact, he has left his homeland
            and gone in search of adventure as a knight-errant.
            Because of this passion, he sees himself and observes the ideals of chivalry:
            honesty, honor, he believes in defending the weak, in spells, and in the mission
            of defeating the Saracen enemies (who are no longer their real enemy).
            He is a tall, thin, madman, but cultured and intelligent. <br> 
            Don Quixote sets out alone for the first time, but is brought 
            home badly injured. He then sets out again with the peasant 
            Sancho Panza, to whom he promises the government of an island. 
            At this stage, his madness is "active": he transforms reality to fit his books. 
            Each adventure ends in a resounding physical defeat,
            but Quixote always attributes his failures to "envious magicians." 
            <br> In the second part of the novel, the situation is reversed: 
            it is others (such as the Dukes) who create fake chivalric situations 
            to taunt him. Quixote is forced to return to his village. 
            Once home, his melancholy turns into a fever that leads to his death. 
            Before dying, he suddenly regains his sanity: he renounces chivalry, 
            asks Sancho for forgiveness, and dies like the wise Alonso Quijano.

                <p> Sancho is Don Quixote's squire; he is stocky and short, 
                    often contrasting with Quixote's tall, lean physique. 
                    Sancho is loyal, staying with the Knight even when he 
                    realizes he won't get any "island" (or that the island is a scam).
                    He does so because he loves his master; he says he could never 
                    leave him because Don Quixote is "a pure soul" who wouldn't hurt a fly.
                    Sancho is the only bridge between Don Quixote and Dulcinea.
                    Sancho is the one who is supposed to bring her letters 
                    (which he often fails to deliver or pretends to) and Sancho knows that Dulcinea is Aldonza.
                    Toward the end of the novel, Sancho begins to believe in the ideals of chivalry. 
                    As Don Quixote returns to reason and becomes sad, Sancho tries to cheer him 
                    up by inviting him to become shepherds and experience new adventures. 
                    This exchange of personalities is called by critics the <b>"Sanchization"</b>
                    of Don Quixote and the <b>"Quixotization"</b> of Sancho.

            She never physically appears in the novel, 
            but she is the one of the most important character 
            after the protagonists. She is the woman idealized by Quixote, 
            for whom he does everything. In reality, her name is <b>Aldonza Lorenzo</b>,
            a local peasant woman who, according to Sancho, is better at salting pigs 
            than at being a noble lady. She is strong, but in Don Quixote's head she has 
            blonde hair and alabaster skin. <br>
            She's the reason why Quixote does everything, every battle 
            is dedicated to her; every victory is for her glory. She is the purest embodiment of <b>Beauty and Virtue</b>. <br>
            Sancho, to get out of a mess, convinces Quixote that an ugly and graceless peasant girl 
            he meets on the road is Dulcinea, 
            "enchanted" by evil magicians. 
            This psychologically destroys Don Quixote: 
            his ideal woman now appears to him as a crude vision, and he will spend the rest of the 
            book trying to "disenchant" her, something he never succeeds in doing, as it was a lie.

                They are the protagonist's friends from the village. They often try to
                cure Don Quixote's madness. They burn his books of chivalry
                to try to bring him back to his senses, and often disguise themselves to trick him
                home. In the first part of the work, they fail: after tracking him
                down in the Sierra Morena, they convince him to put himself in a wooden cage mounted on an oxcart,
                making him believe he's under a spell.
                Don Quixote, convinced that his imprisonment is the work of jealous magicians, 
                passively accepts the situation. 
                He arrives at his village locked in the cage, to the astonishment of his neighbors, 
                but the "return to order" is short-lived: the desire for new adventures is too strong, 
                and after a period of rest, he sets off on his second expedition. <br>
                In the second part of the novel, they realize that the only way to stop 
                him is to defeat him on his own ground: chivalry.
                They ask Samson, who disguises himself as the Knight of the White Moon and challenges Don Quixote in Barcelona.
                Don Quixote loses the duel and, according to the rules of honor he 
                himself professes, must abide by the pact established before the challenge: 
                to return to his village and not take up arms for an entire year.
                In the end, Don Quixote keeps his word and returns home.

                These two nobles appear in Part Two of the novel. 
                Unlike the other characters, they have read Part One of the book and are already 
                familiar with Don Quixote, making the novel a <b>metafictional</b> novel.
                Rather than openly mocking him in the streets, they invite him to their 
                castle and treat him like a true knight-errant. It seems like a dream come true for Don Quixote, but it's a trap.
                The dukes spend fortunes on theatrical sets, actors, and makeup just to 
                see how the Knight and Sancho react. These pranks include: <b>the flight over Clavilegno</b>, 
                where they make the two believe they are flying on a magical wooden horse 
                (while they are blindfolded and someone blows air with bellows and burns 
                tow near their faces to simulate the heat of the sun); <b>Sancho's government</b>: 
                they entrust Sancho with the island of Barataria only to see him fail, even though 
                he later turns out to be an excellent governor. <br>
                Through The Dukes, Cervantes criticizes the nobility of his time: 
                bored rich people who, for pure entertainment, torment two poor, deluded people.

            He's the fake arabian writer, the author (Cervantes) claims to be the true author of the story. 
            Cervantes presents himself only as the "editor" who found and translated the manuscript.
            In books of chivalry, authors often claimed to have found "ancient chronicles." Cervantes mocks this practice.
            Since Cide is Arab, and Arabs were viewed with suspicion in Spain at the time, 
            Cervantes can blame him if something in the story seems exaggerated or false. 
            With this, Cervantes creates different levels of narration: there is the action, 
            there is the historian who writes it (Cide), the translator who turns it into Spanish 
            and Cervantes who comments on it.
