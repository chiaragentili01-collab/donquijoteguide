            <h1>Miguel de Cervantes Saveedra </h1>
        <p> 
            Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra was born in 1547 in Alcalá de Henares and
            is considered the creator of the modern novel, thanks to the two 
            parts of <em>Don Quixote</em>. He was a soldier in his youth: 
            he fought in the <b>Battle of Lepanto</b> (1571), where he lost the use of his left hand.
            While returning to Spain in 1575, the ship he was traveling on was captured by 
            the Saracens and he was taken prisoner. 
            He remained imprisoned in Algiers for five years. 
            He was ransomed by the Mercedarian friars, who were responsible 
            for bringing prisoners back to their homeland. 
            In 1580 he published his first narrative experiment, <em>La Galatea</em>, 
            which falls within the pastoral novel genre. 
            The first <em>Don Quixote</em> was published only in 1605, 
            and enjoyed enormous success. The second part was published in 1615.<br>
            In the following years, he intensified his 
            publishing activity, with the publication 
            of <em>Exemplary Novelse</em> in 1613, followed by <em>Viaje del Parnaso</em>, 
            <em>Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes</em>, and <em>Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda</em>, 
            completed just before his death.
            He signed the dedication of his last work, <em>Persiles</em>, four days before his death. 
            The work, modeled after the Byzantine novel, was published posthumously the following year.

            <h2>About Don Quixote</h2> 
            <p>During Cervantes's time, chivalric romances were widely 
                circulated and had a large readership. Cervantes capitalized 
                on his era's great love for chivalric romances to ridicule 
                knights and their ideals. He did so not because he considered 
                them foolish, but because he understood that society, despite its 
                love of these stories, has nothing to do with the virtue of knights,
                and there is no longer any room for literature in the present. 
                The futility of Don Quixote's ideals is evident in the way all his adventures fail: 
                he begins confidently, full of ideals, but lashes out against trivialities and, 
                what's more, always emerges ridiculed. Don Quixote is not an epic poem for two reasons:
                first, unlike epic poems, it is a work written in prose; second, because of the work's plot,
                the narrative style, and the characteristics of the protagonist; 
                Don Quixote is considered by many scholars to be the first important <b>modern novel</b>,
                somewhere between the humorous and the adventurous genres.
                Don Quixote is a succession of disastrous and hilarious adventures, 
                and the style of this tale is fluid, clear, and ironic.
